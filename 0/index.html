      <b><i>No action is required and no personal information was stored.</i><br>
        This study is approved by both the IRB and the Division of Information Technology.</b></p> 
        <p>The email you received was part of a research study being conducted in the University of Maryland Department of Computer Science.
           The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of phishing emails generated by large language models.
            The email you received was a simulated malicious email.
              It was not written by a human, but rather automatically generated by a computer system that had access to your publicly available professional web page.
              <i>We request that you do not discuss this email with other faculty members until the study is concluded in two weeks.</i>
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, in order to properly test our hypothesis, we could not provide you with certain information
          prior to sending you the email. This ensured that your reaction to the email was spontaneous, genuine, and not influenced by prior knowledge about the purpose of the study.
           If we had told you the actual purpose of the study, your ability to decide whether or not to click the link could have been affected.
            We regret the deception of the phishing email but hope that you understand the reason for it.
          <br>
        <p>This experiment was conducted by Thomas Armstrong, Michael Lupo, and Srikar Cheeti as part of CMSC473 at the University of Maryland.<br>
