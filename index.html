      <h1 style='vertical-align:middle; display:inline;'>Thank you for participating in this phishing study.</h1>
        <p>Sorry to deceive you, but the email you received was part of a research study involving ChatGPT generated phishing attacks.<br>
          The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of phishing attacks generated by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, in order to properly test our hypothesis, we could not provide you with certain information
          prior to sending you the email. This ensured that your reaction to the email was spontaneous, genuine, and not influenced by prior knowledge about the purpose of the study.
           If we had told you the actual purpose of the study, your ability to decide whether or not to click the link could have been affected.
            we regret the deception of the phishing email but hope that you understand the reason for it.
          <br><br>
          <b><i>No action is required and no personal information was stored.</i></b></p> 
        <p>The email you received was generated by ChatGPT prompted with publically available information.</p>
        <p>This experiment was conducted by Thomas Armstrong, Michael Lupo, and Srikar Cheeti as part of CMSC473 at the University of Maryland.<br>
